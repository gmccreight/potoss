version 20080630_1
Added the page name to the page titles.  Easier to see which page is
which when you have multiple tabs open in your browser, or when reviewing
your browser history.

version 20080619_2
Changes to the selenium test file:
Starting up and shutting down the browser after ~20 tests appears to
speed the tests up overall.  There is some speculation about why at
http://citechnology.blogspot.com/2007/11/improving-selenium-performance-in-ie6.html
All I know is that for my (Gordon's) setup the tests would get *very*
slow as time went on, and they //appear// to be faster when I shut down
and start up the browser over and over after only a small number of
tests have occurred.

version 20080619_1
Luke Closs pointed me to universaleditbutton.org, which is a compelling idea.
Added application/wiki links in the <head>, but then realized that I'd never
gotten around to adding application/rss+xml links to <head>, so did that too.
Also decided to update my in-code tags to my standard [tag:some_tag:gem]
format.
Also added the is_last_test option to each test, to be able to short
circuit the tests if you really only need to run a section of them.

version 20080618_1
Updated the path to the Selenium Remote Control server so that it
would run the version that controls Firefox 3.  Firefox 3 passes
all tests.

version 20080617_1
Changed the Selenium test file again.  Now uses an array of hash
references for the tests.

version 20080613_1
Updated the Selenium test file to use a new format.  Each "story" is
now in a seperate subroutine with a few definitions added as a smart
comment of sorts.  So, for example, you can solo tests, or mark that
tests shouldn't be run.  This is all done directly at the location of
the story, so there's no need to fill out a seperate hash at the top
of the test.
This new approach is really nice because you can simply add the code
for a new test, turn solo => 1, and it will just run that one test.
Once that test is working well, you can turn solo off, and all the
tests will run.

version 20080528_1
Focus on the new page name field when creating a new page.
Removed the _maybe_add_blog_heading routine, which was always meant
to be temporary.  Using separate greasemonkey script now to generate
date information at the top, if needed.  I can't add it as a utility
yet because it contains some code which had a questionable
redistribution policy.

version 20080424_1
Added the page_submit parameter: nm_skip_revision_num_check.  This
parameter allows you to force the new version, for example if you're
writing a client for the potoss service.

Also changed the version of the selenium remote control, which almost
nobody would care about... but I thought I'd document it anyhow.

version 20080418_1
Added the ability to have a search box at the top of your page.  It
can be enabled via the "advanced options -> more advanced" tab.  Also,
added some page creation options to allow for easily adding the search
boxes as part of the page creation process.

version 20080416_1
Added the ability to create one way links easily

version 20080401_3
A link search will now show page *name* matches as well as "content"

version 20080401_2
Very small change to make selenium write log files.

version 20080401_1
Added the Selenium tests for the functionality I added yesterday.

version 20080331_2
Fixed a bug I introduced in the last version, but more importantly
I added the ability to create related pages super quickly.

version 20080331_1
Moved the file read and write functionality into a separate module
and added width and height options for the text area, which you can
speficy in the URL: nm_textarea_cols=100&nm_textarea_rows=30

version 20080224_1
Added a client-side check to make sure that pages with encryption
buttons are actually encrypted prior to being sent to the server.

version 20071111_3
Added POT_RPC.pm and pot_add.cgi to the utils directory.  They are
the beginnings of useful remote procedure scripts.

version 20071111_2
Small tweak to make sure that old PH_page_links RSS feeds still work.

version 20071111_1
Made it so you can get either just the changes, or the changes
and the full text in your RSS feeds.

version 20071109_1
Made the search input get automatically selected in the Links
search page.

version 20070926_2
Updated the tests to reflect the fact that the one of the creation
pages has been removed.

version 20070926_1
Updated the "find" page so that it is programmatic, but you can
still ask the site administrator if you're still unable to find
the page.

version 20070924_1
Removed one of the creation pages, so it goes directly to the page
after creating it.

version 20070921_1
Properly escape single quotes in the diff rollovers in the
"links" view.

version 20070919_1
Only add the table sorting javascript if there is actually a table
in the rendered Creole.

version 20070918_1
In the links view, don't show circular linked page names if you're
looking at a "recent changes" style listing.  They only make sense
to show in the hierarchical listing.
        
version 20070915_2
Made the "create a new page of x" message pay attention to the
CNF_DEFAULT_PAGE_FORMAT variable.

version 20070915_1
Added the CNF_DEFAULT_PAGE_FORMAT variable, which lets you specify
either text or creole.

version 20070914_1
Made creole tables sortable.

version 20070913_1
Added a message about the text using Creole, and added the cheat sheet.

version 20070912_2
Fixed small bug in the text handling that was causing Text::WikiCreole
to choke on making paragraphs.

version 20070912_1
Added the Text::WikiCreole module and the option of using it to
parse the html.

version 20070829_1
In the "links" view, allow backing up of all the currently viewed
pages (and their options) to a zipped tarball.  Also, made the interface
for these two options a bit more verbose and obvious.

version 20070717_4
Resolve page aliases when calculating diffs for a page
for the rollovers in the links page.

version 20070717_3
Updated the style of the rollover box a bit.

version 20070717_2
Forgot to escape single quotes in the diff rollovers.

version 20070717_1
Added rollovers for the diffs of the latest four revisions to
the PH_links page.

version 20070710_3
Allow page links with a different label than the page name.

version 20070710_2
If you have no_opts specified, then it will propogate to pages
which are linked from the current page.  Added several tests to
make sure this happens, too.

version 20070710_1
A simple no_opts so that it remains after a page edit.

version 20070704_2
Added pruning to the page links list.  Added a couple of tests
for it, too.

version 20070704_1
Sped up the rss feed generation for the links search by removing
the check for each page name's validity.

version 20070703_1
Added the rss feed for the page links search.

version 20070702_1
Removed the page name check from the recursive links processing.
This greatly increases the speed of the processing.

version 20070622_2
Made the edit "cancel" button do the right thing instead of just
going 'back'.  Added a handful of tests to the Selenium tests
to check for the proper functioning of the "cancel" button.

version 20070622_1
Fix for: If you click "edit this page" on an older page, it
correctly warns you that you are editing an older version.
If you click on "Edit the latest version", it continues to
warn you that you are editing an older version.

version 20070620_1
The redirects didn't actually work in IE, but now they do.

version 20070619_1
Changes to the built-in server to make it handle redirects and
give normal headers properly.

version 20070618_2
Added the expires HTTP header to expire each page -1d (ASAP!)
This ought to keep browsers from caching the page.

version 20070618_1
Added a fallback library of modules to help make installation
super-fast.

version 20070617_4
Came up with a better alternative to the "loops back" wording in the
link tree page.

version 20070617_3
Fixed a bug in the is_a_valid_link subroutine.  It needed to resolve
a page alias before testing if it could link to the page.

version 20070617_2
When you use the quick palette to make a change, then close it,
it now updates the page.

version 20070617_1
Only have the encrypt button when in "edit" mode.  There's no point
to it in the "view" mode.  Updated the Selenium tests.

version 20070616_1
Added caching to the links out of a page.  It stores all *possible*
links out of a page so that if a link is incipient, and subsequently
a page is created which makes it real, it does not need to track
backwards to tell the linking page that it's now a real link.
Added a large number of tests and added sections of subroutines
with the preface sect: for easier searchability.
Also, added a more informative "throw" when in testing mode.

version 20070615_2
Updated the links search page to allow for sorting based on
different criteria, such as modified time, so it acts like a recent
changes page.

version 20070615_2
Made the search case-insensitive

version 20070615_1
Added the ability to do a very simple search all your linked pages.

version 20070614_4
Added much more sophistication to the link tree creation.

version 20070614_3
You can now encrypt and decrypt multiple line pages.

version 20070614_2
Made a small post-decryption addition to the Blowfish code to strip
the block cipher padding.

version 20070614_1
Fixed an Internet Explorer bug where it can't handle XHTML formatted script
elements.  Since that's fixed, I re-added the keyboard shortcuts, but
changed the key to w, since f was a bad key (it's used in the CTRL-f
for "find" key combo).

version 20070613_2
Moved potoss development to Google Code.

version 20070613_1
Temporarily removed the js shortcuts becaused they caused all content to
disappear in IE.  Whoops!!!  Added IE back into the selenium tests so
we'll catch that issue if it pops up again.

version 20070611_1
Added the PH_page_links URL, which shows all the links which originate
and propogate from a page.

version 20070610_3
Added configurable sex (just a simple he/she) for the administrator.

version 20070610_2
Moved the get_or_put.pl file to "utils".  Added a link to take you to
the latest, HEAD, revision of a page, like if you come in from an RSS feed
which is pointing to an earlier revision.
Added some notes about installation, though they are still a little patchy.

version 20070610_1
Added the ability to use keyboard shortcuts.  The first one is 'f',
which brings up some page options when looking at the text.

version 20070608_2
Rearranged the advanced options a bit.  Added a note about double-clicking.
  
version 20070608_1
* In configuration file:
    ** Die instead of warning if missing data directories.
    ** Uses a dot (for current directory) instead of ENV variable.
* Changed the selenium test directory.  Ultimately it should be in the
  configuration file as well, but for now it's not.
* Added two #TEMPLATE_ notes to the code.  These allow Gordon to do
  some simple code substitution required for pageoftext.com (adding a
  couple simple subroutines of pageoftext.com specific material at
  those locations)

version 20070605_3
Luke Closs removed hardcoded config path and added a check
on the configured directories.  He also added a feature:
double-click the page text to edit.

version 20070605_2
Added the code to automatically normalize the page's name when creating
it.  So, if you try to create a page, "My dog is always hungry!", it
will come back with a suggested name of "my_dog_is_always_hungry", rather
than just giving you an error suggesting that you change it yourself.
Added ~20 tests for in the class test and web tests.

version 20070605_1
Took Luke Closs's suggestion of adding the RSS feed icon to each page.

version 20070531_1
Added the ability to download a tgz of the page and all is options.

version 20070530_4
Updated the run_test_http_server.pl file to correctly run the
standalone simple http server.

version 20070530_3
Added revision conflict detection.

version 20070530_2
A big restructure of the code and data files.

version 20070530_1
Added an HTTP::Server::Simple web server to the code.
Also added simple get_or_post.pl script which is just in its
infancy.  The idea is that you will be able to use pageoftext
directly from a text editor.

version 20070529_2
Fixed a bug about not updating the linkable pages cache
when a file option was updated.  Forgot to call:
_calculate_linkable_pages_cache()

version 20070529_1
Fixed a bug where people were able to create pages which were
the same as words in the dictionary.  Added several tests to make
sure the bug stays fixed.

version 20070527_2
Added the URL command line option to not show the "Advanced Options".

version 20070527_1
Added the ability to override the color of the bar for better
branding when embedding.  This required also changing the way
page options worked just a little bit.

version 20070525_2
Added a backup folder for the page revisions because I toasted the
data directory by accident.  This will be an additional layer of
data safety.

version 20070525_1
Added a small performance tweak.  Removed whitespace from the printing
of the html, so the page will take slightly less bandwidth.

version 20070524_3
For embedding you can now remove the container div, the branding, and
the 'create a new page' link (all from the advanced options)

version 20070524_2
Updated the page options (fopts) code to make it much more easily extensible.
Moved all the information into a hash, so you just need to add more items to
the hash to give more page options.

version 20070524_1
BIG change.  Moved to a new text directory and normalized to an _[A-Z]
for all the files associated with page_name.  Added an update script
to version control as well.

version 20070523_1
Added a slew of new tests to the Potoss.t file, and a few new
subroutines to the Potoss.pm file which the tests use to get data
about the text files.

version 20070522_4
Removed the silly joke about adding a new "clock" instead of new page.
The wikiclock is funny enough on its own.  It doesn't need any help.

version 20070522_3
Switched from "use"-ing to requiring as-needed.  This ought to
help mitigate startup times.

version 20070522_2
Added a silly joke about adding a new "clock" instead of new page.
(see gemhack 5 to remove)

version 20070522_1
Added the ability to have the text not be wrapped.
If it's not wrapped, the decorative border disappears,
since it's likely that the text will not fit within the the
bounding box.

version 20070521_2
Added page HEAD revision caching, so it doesn't have to check
all the files each time.

version 20070521_1
Switched to using directories for the revisions.  The directories
are the page names followed by _REVS.

version 20070516_2
Started modularizing.  Added the Potoss.pm module and the start
of an associated test suite.

version 20070516_1
Removed the dependency on File::Slurp by creating my own
_read_file and _write_file subroutines.

version 20070513
Added the front-end support for page encryption.

version 20070510
Added the bulk of the blowfish support, but disabled it for now.
There is still a bit of a mess about decrypting encoded characters.

version 20070508
Added the _slow_down_if_too_many_guesses() subroutine to slow down the
site if some IP address is guessing too many names of pages in a 
short period of time.
