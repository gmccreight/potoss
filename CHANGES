version 20070618_1
Added a fallback library of modules to help make installation
super-fast.

version 20070617_4
Came up with a better alternative to the "loops back" wording in the
link tree page.

version 20070617_3
Fixed a bug in the is_a_valid_link subroutine.  It needed to resolve
a page alias before testing if it could link to the page.

version 20070617_2
When you use the quick palette to make a change, then close it,
it now updates the page.

version 20070617_1
Only have the encrypt button when in "edit" mode.  There's no point
to it in the "view" mode.  Updated the Selenium tests.

version 20070616_1
Added caching to the links out of a page.  It stores all *possible*
links out of a page so that if a link is incipient, and subsequently
a page is created which makes it real, it does not need to track
backwards to tell the linking page that it's now a real link.
Added a large number of tests and added sections of subroutines
with the preface sect: for easier searchability.
Also, added a more informative "throw" when in testing mode.

version 20070615_2
Updated the links search page to allow for sorting based on
different criteria, such as modified time, so it acts like a recent
changes page.

version 20070615_2
Made the search case-insensitive

version 20070615_1
Added the ability to do a very simple search all your linked pages.

version 20070614_4
Added much more sophistication to the link tree creation.

version 20070614_3
You can now encrypt and decrypt multiple line pages.

version 20070614_2
Made a small post-decryption addition to the Blowfish code to strip
the block cipher padding.

version 20070614_1
Fixed an Internet Explorer bug where it can't handle XHTML formatted script
elements.  Since that's fixed, I re-added the keyboard shortcuts, but
changed the key to w, since f was a bad key (it's used in the CTRL-f
for "find" key combo).

version 20070613_2
Moved potoss development to Google Code.

version 20070613_1
Temporarily removed the js shortcuts becaused they caused all content to
disappear in IE.  Whoops!!!  Added IE back into the selenium tests so
we'll catch that issue if it pops up again.

version 20070611_1
Added the PH_page_links URL, which shows all the links which originate
and propogate from a page.

version 20070610_3
Added configurable sex (just a simple he/she) for the administrator.

version 20070610_2
Moved the get_or_put.pl file to "utils".  Added a link to take you to
the latest, HEAD, revision of a page, like if you come in from an RSS feed
which is pointing to an earlier revision.
Added some notes about installation, though they are still a little patchy.

version 20070610_1
Added the ability to use keyboard shortcuts.  The first one is 'f',
which brings up some page options when looking at the text.

version 20070608_2
Rearranged the advanced options a bit.  Added a note about double-clicking.
  
version 20070608_1
* In configuration file:
    ** Die instead of warning if missing data directories.
    ** Uses a dot (for current directory) instead of ENV variable.
* Changed the selenium test directory.  Ultimately it should be in the
  configuration file as well, but for now it's not.
* Added two #TEMPLATE_ notes to the code.  These allow Gordon to do
  some simple code substitution required for pageoftext.com (adding a
  couple simple subroutines of pageoftext.com specific material at
  those locations)

version 20070605_3
Luke Closs removed hardcoded config path and added a check
on the configured directories.  He also added a feature:
double-click the page text to edit.

version 20070605_2
Added the code to automatically normalize the page's name when creating
it.  So, if you try to create a page, "My dog is always hungry!", it
will come back with a suggested name of "my_dog_is_always_hungry", rather
than just giving you an error suggesting that you change it yourself.
Added ~20 tests for in the class test and web tests.

version 20070605_1
Took Luke Closs's suggestion of adding the RSS feed icon to each page.

version 20070531_1
Added the ability to download a tgz of the page and all is options.

version 20070530_4
Updated the run_test_http_server.pl file to correctly run the
standalone simple http server.

version 20070530_3
Added revision conflict detection.

version 20070530_2
A big restructure of the code and data files.

version 20070530_1
Added an HTTP::Server::Simple web server to the code.
Also added simple get_or_post.pl script which is just in its
infancy.  The idea is that you will be able to use pageoftext
directly from a text editor.

version 20070529_2
Fixed a bug about not updating the linkable pages cache
when a file option was updated.  Forgot to call:
_calculate_linkable_pages_cache()

version 20070529_1
Fixed a bug where people were able to create pages which were
the same as words in the dictionary.  Added several tests to make
sure the bug stays fixed.

version 20070527_2
Added the URL command line option to not show the "Advanced Options".

version 20070527_1
Added the ability to override the color of the bar for better
branding when embedding.  This required also changing the way
page options worked just a little bit.

version 20070525_2
Added a backup folder for the page revisions because I toasted the
data directory by accident.  This will be an additional layer of
data safety.

version 20070525_1
Added a small performance tweak.  Removed whitespace from the printing
of the html, so the page will take slightly less bandwidth.

version 20070524_3
For embedding you can now remove the container div, the branding, and
the 'create a new page' link (all from the advanced options)

version 20070524_2
Updated the page options (fopts) code to make it much more easily extensible.
Moved all the information into a hash, so you just need to add more items to
the hash to give more page options.

version 20070524_1
BIG change.  Moved to a new text directory and normalized to an _[A-Z]
for all the files associated with page_name.  Added an update script
to version control as well.

version 20070523_1
Added a slew of new tests to the Potoss.t file, and a few new
subroutines to the Potoss.pm file which the tests use to get data
about the text files.

version 20070522_4
Removed the silly joke about adding a new "clock" instead of new page.
The wikiclock is funny enough on its own.  It doesn't need any help.

version 20070522_3
Switched from "use"-ing to requiring as-needed.  This ought to
help mitigate startup times.

version 20070522_2
Added a silly joke about adding a new "clock" instead of new page.
(see gemhack 5 to remove)

version 20070522_1
Added the ability to have the text not be wrapped.
If it's not wrapped, the decorative border disappears,
since it's likely that the text will not fit within the the
bounding box.

version 20070521_2
Added page HEAD revision caching, so it doesn't have to check
all the files each time.

version 20070521_1
Switched to using directories for the revisions.  The directories
are the page names followed by _REVS.

version 20070516_2
Started modularizing.  Added the Potoss.pm module and the start
of an associated test suite.

version 20070516_1
Removed the dependency on File::Slurp by creating my own
_read_file and _write_file subroutines.

version 20070513
Added the front-end support for page encryption.

version 20070510
Added the bulk of the blowfish support, but disabled it for now.
There is still a bit of a mess about decrypting encoded characters.

version 20070508
Added the _slow_down_if_too_many_guesses() subroutine to slow down the
site if some IP address is guessing too many names of pages in a 
short period of time.
