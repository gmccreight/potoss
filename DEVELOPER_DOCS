You can speed up the code by:

1) removing "use strict;" and "use warnings;"

2) removing the code in between the two lines:

     #start_of_strict_tests-can_remove_for_performance
     some strict testing code in here
     tends to slow things down, but makes development more robust
     #end_of_strict_tests-can_remove_for_performance

I would suggest a pipeline where you have a master location.  Using a script
you copy that master location to another one, then run the stripping code,
which you write, on the new location.
