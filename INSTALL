Installing POTOSS (The source of pageoftext.com)
---

For the moment, once you unpack the tarball, try running:
perl ./index.cgi
It will undoubtedly fail with some messages about missing Perl modules.
You'll need to use the cpan shell to install a couple modules.  To do this,
type:
sudo cpan
Once the cpan program is up and running, you can install the needed modules.

Once the modules are installed, you should be able to set up Apache to
launch the perl script.  See the PotConf.pm file in the potoss_code folder
for an example of a working Apache configuration.

Before starting to add data to your installation, you should go into the
potoss_code directory and run:
perl Potoss.t
which will run a suite of tests on your installation to make sure that
various things work.

In the future, the plans are to include all the modules needed to make the
potoss code run out of the box.  We're not there yet.
