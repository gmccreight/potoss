Installing potoss (The source of pageoftext.com)
---

For the moment, once you clone from github, try running:
perl ./index.cgi
It will likely succeed.

Next, try cd'ing to potoss_code and run:
perl ./run_test_web_server.pl

The site should work fine, except for the RSS feeds.  They will fail if you
don't have the perl DateTime module installed.

To install the DateTime module on Ubuntu,
run the following command:
sudo aptitude install libdatetime-perl

If you're on another system, you can use the cpan shell to
the DateTime module.  To do this, type:
sudo cpan
Once the cpan program is up and running, you can install the module.

Once the module is installed, you should be able to set up Apache to
launch the perl script (better than relying on the test web server).
See the PotConf.pm file in the potoss_code folder for an example of a
working Apache configuration.

Before starting to add data to your installation, you should go into the
potoss_code directory and run:
perl Potoss.t
which will run a suite of tests on your installation to make sure that
various things work.
If it fails because it doesn't have Test::Exception, then you'll need to install
it.  You can install it in Ubuntu by typing:
sudo aptitude install libtest-exception-perl
